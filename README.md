# Theory
Essentially a database of everything needed for technical knowledge in CTF, crypto, and any competitions we might participate in/create. There are several folders: Security, which is for technical backgrounds in database security and provably private storage techniques, Game Theory And Rational Computation which is to model adversary behavior in regards to databases, information, or cryptography protocols, and Discrete Math/Number Theory/Miscellany, which will be all the handy stuff to know for modeling and optimizing solutions and scripts.
