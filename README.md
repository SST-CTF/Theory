# Theory
Essentially a database of everything needed for technical knowledge in CTF, crypto, and any competitions we might participate in/create. There are several folders: Security, which is for technical backgrounds in database security and provably private storage techniques, Game Theory And Rational Computation which is to model adversary behavior in regards to databases, information, or cryptography protocols, and Discrete Math/Number Theory/Miscellany, which will be all the handy stuff to know for modeling and optimizing solutions and scripts.

## Security
Formalized notions of what is "private", methods of ensuring privacy, formalized analyses of common database and cryptographical attacks. For the knight in shining armor that wishes to protect the valuable data at hand.

## Game Theory/Rational Computation
Formalized notions of multiple parties and adversaries competing or collaborating in different environs, can be used for security proofs or for simulations of crypto schemes. For the neutral observer of the grand struggle.

## Discrete Math/Number Theory/Miscellany 
Wanna understand modulus/modulo, elliptic curves, group theory, graph theory, and any other mathematical residue (hehehe) that might be helpful to you later on in cracking some protocol. Look no further! For the dastardly blackguard of a villain who wishes but to only steal innocent people's flags/information.
